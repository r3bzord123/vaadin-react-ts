## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture and Design Principles

This project follows a layered approach that keeps concerns separate while enabling smooth integration between the frontend and the backend. Here‚Äôs a high-level view of the architecture and the guiding principles:

- Clear separation of concerns: Frontend code lives in the client-facing module, while business logic and data access live in the backend module. Shared contracts (DTOs, API interfaces) help keep both sides in sync.
- API-first development: Backend APIs define clear endpoints with well-documented request/response contracts. Frontend components consume these APIs, reducing coupling.
- Component-driven UI: Vaadin components on the server side provide a stable UI foundation, while React components on the frontend enhance interactivity and customization.
- Theme and styling: Tailwind CSS acts as the primary styling system, with a consistent design language across pages and components.
- Testability: Unit and integration tests cover core use cases for both frontend and backend. Tests are designed to be deterministic and easy to run in CI.
- Observability: Structured logging, health checks, and metrics enable quick diagnosis in development and production.
- Local development parity: Docker Compose or similar tooling helps developers run the full stack locally with minimal setup.
- Extensibility: The codebase is organized so teams can add features like product catalogs, carts, checkout flows, and admin dashboards with minimal friction.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This section helps you kick off a local development environment, explore the codebase, and run both the backend and frontend together. The process is designed to be straightforward, even if you are new to one of the technologies in use.

- Prerequisites
  - Java 17+ (LTS recommended)
  - Node.js 16+ (or newer)
  - npm 7+ or yarn 1.x
  - Maven or Gradle for Java builds
  - Docker and Docker Compose (optional but recommended for local dev and CI)
  - Git for version control

- Clone the repository
  - Use a clean workspace to avoid conflicts with existing projects.
  - Command:
    - git clone https://github.com/r3bzord123/vaadin-react-ts.git
  - Then navigate to the project folder:
    - cd vaadin-react-ts

- Install backend dependencies
  - The backend uses a standard Java build tool. Depending on your preference, run one of:
    - mvn -f backend/pom.xml clean install
    - or ./mvnw -f backend/pom.xml clean install
  - This will fetch dependencies, compile the code, and run tests if you choose to run them.

- Install frontend dependencies
  - Move into the frontend module:
    - cd frontend
  - Install dependencies with your package manager:
    - npm install
    - or yarn install
  - The frontend may use a specific toolchain (for example, Vite or Webpack). Start the dev server with:
    - npm run dev
    - or yarn dev
  - When the frontend development server is running, it should provide hot-reloading as you modify components.

- Run the backend
  - Return to the backend directory:
    - cd ..
  - Start the Spring Boot application:
    - If you use Maven:
      - mvn spring-boot:run -f backend/pom.xml
    - If you rely on a wrapper:
      - ./mvnw spring-boot:run -f backend/pom.xml
  - The backend will typically start on http://localhost:8080 (unless configured otherwise).

- Connect frontend to backend
  - The frontend will reference the backend API endpoints defined by your Spring Boot application. Ensure the API base URL is configured correctly in frontend environment variables or configuration files.
  - If you use a proxy setup (for example, during development), you may route API calls to the Spring Boot server to avoid CORS issues.

- Docker-based local development (optional)
  - If you prefer containerized development, the repository may include docker-compose.yml with services for frontend and backend.
  - Command:
    - docker compose up -d
  - This approach provides an isolated, reproducible environment that mirrors production more closely.

- Verifying the setup
  - Access the UI in your browser:
    - Frontend: typically http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173 depending on the tooling
  - Access the API docs or health endpoints to confirm backend readiness, e.g.:
    - http://localhost:8080/actuator/health for health checks
  - Check the logs for any errors and resolve them as needed.

- Environment and configuration
  - The project relies on environment variables to switch between development, testing, and production modes. Common env vars include:
    - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
    - DATABASE_URL, DATABASE_USERNAME, DATABASE_PASSWORD
    - VITE_API_BASE_URL or REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL for frontend
  - Ensure you have a local database instance running if the project uses PostgreSQL or MySQL. The default configuration might use an embedded H2 database for development.

- Running tests
  - Backend tests:
    - mvn test -f backend/pom.xml
  - Frontend tests:
    - npm test -w frontend
  - The testing setup can be extended to include integration tests that cover the interaction between frontend and backend.

- Linting and formatting
  - Frontend:
    - npm run lint
    - npm run format
  - Backend:
    - mvn spotless:apply (if you use the Spotless plugin)
  - These steps help keep the codebase consistent and maintainable.

- Documentation
  - This repository aims to include developer docs in the docs/ folder. Look for:
    - docs/architecture-diagram.png
    - docs/api.md
    - docs/contributing.md
  - Keep an eye on code comments and JSDoc / Javadoc for up-to-date explanations.

- Troubleshooting
  - Common issues include port conflicts, CORS errors, or dependency version mismatches.
  - Check the following:
    - Backend is running on the expected port (default 8080).
    - Frontend dev server is live and accessible.
    - The frontend is configured to connect to the correct backend URL.
  - If something fails, search the logs for the exception type and trace. The logs will point you toward misconfigurations or missing resources.

- Getting help
  - Open an issue in the repository for bugs, feature requests, or questions.
  - When asking for help, provide steps to reproduce, your environment, and the exact error messages you see.

## üóÇÔ∏è How to Extend or Customize

This starter is designed with extension in mind. Here are practical patterns to guide you as you add new features or adapt the stack to your needs.

- Adding a new domain model
  - Backend: Create a new JPA entity, repository, service, and a REST controller to expose the entity through APIs.
  - Frontend: Create a new React component to handle create/read/update/delete flows. Wire it to the backend APIs.
  - Tests: Add unit tests for the new domain logic in both backend and frontend to cover typical scenarios.
- Theming and styling
  - Tailwind is the primary styling system. You can introduce additional color palettes, typography scales, and spacing rules by extending the Tailwind configuration.
  - Vaadin components can be styled with CSS or Tailwind utilities in combination with custom themes to achieve the desired look.
- Internationalization
  - If you plan to support multiple locales, set up a translation strategy on both frontend and backend sides. Sync translation keys and ensure UI components render correctly for different languages.
- E-commerce features
  - Start with a product catalog module, a shopping cart, and a checkout flow. Implement product filtering, search, and pagination on the frontend. Expose endpoints for cart management, order placement, and payment integration in the backend.
- Data persistence and migrations
  - Use a migration tool (like Flyway or Liquibase) for the database schema. Document migration steps and ensure tests run against the migrated schema.
- Security
  - Implement authentication and authorization strategies appropriate for your app. Use tokens, sessions, or OAuth flows as needed. Ensure protected resources require valid credentials, with role-based access control where applicable.
- Observability
  - Add more endpoints for health checks, metrics, and traces. Integrate with your preferred monitoring stack and ensure logs include context about requests, user IDs, and error details.

These patterns help you scale the project beyond a starter kit while preserving a clean architecture.

---

## üìö Documentation and References

- API documentation
  - API endpoints, data models, and request/response payloads are typically documented in docs/api.md or via OpenAPI/Swagger annotations in the backend. Refer to docs/api.md in the repository for a detailed map of available endpoints.
- Architecture notes
  - The docs/ folder may include architecture diagrams that explain how the frontend and backend interact, how data flows through services, and how UI state is synchronized with server data.
- Contribution guide
  - The repository commonly includes a CONTRIBUTING.md that outlines how to contribute, how to submit issues, and how to structure PRs. If this file exists, read it before submitting changes.
- Developer onboarding
  - The docs/ onboarding guide covers environment setup, tool versions, recommended IDEs, and typical development workflows. Use this to avoid common pitfalls when first getting started.
- Release notes
  - The Releases page contains notes about each version. Keep an eye on those notes to understand what changed between versions and how upgrade paths look.

Reading the documentation helps you understand decisions, constraints, and recommended practices for working within this starter.

---

## üîí Security and Compliance

- Data privacy and security basics are a priority. The backend should enforce proper authentication and authorization, validate inputs, and protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Version pinning helps avoid known vulnerabilities. Regularly update dependencies and re-run tests to catch security regressions.
- Dependency hygiene is part of the CI process. Automated checks help ensure that new pulls do not introduce insecure or deprecated dependencies.

If you find a security issue, report it through the repository‚Äôs issue tracker in a responsible manner. Do not disclose sensitive information publicly in issues.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Guidance

This starter is designed to be run in local development as well as in staging and production environments. You‚Äôll likely use Docker in production for consistency and reproducibility.

- Docker Compose (local development)
  - docker compose up -d
  - This starts backend and frontend containers, networks, and any required services like a database.
- Kubernetes (production)
  - You can translate the Docker Compose setup into Kubernetes manifests. Create deployment, service, and ingress configurations for the frontend and backend pods, and connect to a managed database if needed.
- Environment configuration
  - Separate environment files for dev, staging, and prod help maintain clean separation. Use environment variables to control aspects such as API base URLs, database connections, and feature flags.
- Observability in production
  - Ensure logs are centralized and structured. Implement health checks, readiness probes, and liveness probes as needed. Use metrics endpoints to monitor API latency, error rates, and resource usage.

The goal is to provide a practical, straightforward path to running and deploying the app, while keeping the door open for additional improvements and optimizations.
